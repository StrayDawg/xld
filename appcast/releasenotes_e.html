<p><strong>Version 20110508:</a></strong></p>
<p>
This is a <b>BETA</b> release for a CD burn feature. You can skip this update unless you are interested in the feature. Feedback is welcome.</p>
<p>
Clicking "Burn CD" button in the toolbar of the track list window triggers a CD burner. Apple's standard CD burner GUI will appear and proceed.</p>
<p>
Note that the verification process requires an offset correction, so both read/write offset value (in CD Burn pref) should be set correctly for the exact match. Otherwise the verification will fail. If you are not sure about the write offset of your drive, burn AccurateRip verifiable image with the write offset 0, and rip the burned disc with the correct read offset. Then, the AR report will suggest offset values, and the relative one will be the write offset.</p>
<p>
Here is a current status list of the XLD burner:</p>
<ul>
<li>XLD <b>does</b>
<ul>
<li>write flac/ape/wv/etc+cue image to CD directly
<li>take care of write offset
<li>reproduce pregap length
<li>write ISRC/MCN
<li>write pre-emphasis/DCP flag
</ul>
<li>XLD <b>does not</b> (at this moment)
<ul>
<li>handle HTOA perfectly</li>
Due to the limitation of Apple's framework, some drives fail to burn images including HTOA (MATSHITA will work, NEC/Pioneer will not). And HTOA longer than 1 second is truncated.
<li>create Mixed Mode CD
<li>create Enhanced CD (CD-Extra)
<li>write CD-Text
</ul>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 20110502:</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a feature to open folder as a disc</li>
Now you can open folder which contains some files without cue sheet as a disc and can lookup metadata, check AccurateRip, etc. Available in the File menu.
<li>Supported MCN tag in the vorbiscomment metadata</li>
<li>Fixed a problem that saving .cue setting was not preserved</li>
<li>Fixed an extension issue when saving offset corrected files</li>
<li>Updated Russian localization resources</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20110417:</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the option to save .cue automatically when ripping to separated track files</li>
Note that .cue is created only when ripping all tracks at the same time.
<li>Fixed a bug when saving non compliant cue sheet of the discs with HTOA</li>
<li>"Apply this item to all files" context menu in the tag editor works for the compilation check box</li>
<li>Minor tweaks in the progress window</li>

<li>Added Spanish localization</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20110228:</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>implemented a profile manager</li>
Now you can save frequently used settings as a profile and quickly switch them through the profile menu.
<li>Fixed a problem when creating a single image file from files associated with non-compliant cue sheet</li>
<li>Genre or release date info for individual tracks is now saved correctly in the cue sheet</li>
<li>Fixed a problem when writing a comment tag which contains break lines to the cue sheet</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20110226:</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for reading cue sheet associated with multiple files (aka "noncompliant" cuesheet)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20110212:</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a feature to set the default value of the comment tag</li>
<li>Added an option to choose preferred CDDB service (FreeDB vs MusicBrainz)</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an incorrect TOC detection on some drives</li>
<li>Fixed some problems regarding the "Delete original files" option</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20101208:</a></strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Fixed a potential memory leak</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20101128:</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Supported AccurateRip2 CRC</li>
If XLD finds a match with AR2 CRC, a log says like
<pre>
    AccurateRip signature  : 01234567
       ->Accurately ripped! (AR2, confidence 10)
</pre>
<li>Supported offset finding CRC in AR database</li>
Now XLD uses offset finding CRC for detecting different pressings. It works better for the first and last track.
<li>Fixed a problem that a filename format identifier %A did not work for 1-to-1 file transcoding</li>
<li>Fixed a problem when ripping with 0 offset correction value</li>
<li>Fixed a crash problem when read error occured</li>
<li>Various small fixes around the ripping log</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20101120:</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Supported DCP (Digital Copy Permitted) flag</li>
<li>More robust TOC reading</li>
<li>A bit better error correction in XLD Secure Ripper</li>
<li>AccurateRip summary is also shown in the log of AR checker</li>
<li>XLD doesn't show many "Not found"s in the AR summary anymore if the disc is not found in AR database</li> 
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20101117:</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a disc open failure on some drives</li>
<li>Added AccurateRip summary section in the log</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20101115:</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced a new original secure ripping engine</li>
This is a brand-new secure ripping engine employing a statistical error correction and a cache defeat. Generally it shows a better and more consistent result than the existing CDParanoia engine, especially on slightly damaged discs. At this moment it is not turned on by default, but I recommend everyone try it. Enabled by setting "Ripper Mode" option to "XLD Secure Ripper".<br>
Here is a description of the error in the report:
<ul>
<li>Jitter error (maybe fixed)</li>
Number of reads which caused a jitter error. The error occurs when seeking between sectors back and forward heavily - the drive fails to return the accurate sector position and returns a slightly moved position. Fixed by the program in most cases.
<li>Retry sector count</li>
Number of sectors which needed a retry read. The program performs a retry read when the 1st and the 2nd (verify) read results do not match (or when C2 error is detected). In case a statistically consistent result was found with the retry reads, this count is incremented. Not a problem in most cases.
<li>Damaged sector count</li>
Number of sectors in which the program was unable to find a statistically consistent result with the retry reads. Bad result in most cases.
</ul>
<li>Implemented a new CD ripper backed</li>
Libcdio was used as a backend so far, but now it has been replaced with my original implementation. Many troubles like a hangup on CD-extra discs should be fixed now.
<li>Removed a support for CDParanoia II 9.8 engine</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 20101107:</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A versatile multiple-format encoder</li>
Now you can invoke the same encoder with different settings at the same time, like MP3 128kbps & 320kbps.
<li>various small bugfixes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20101031:</a></strong></p>

Now XLD provides TAK decoder powered by <a href=http://www.winehq.org/>Wine</a>. <b>You should install and configure Wine correctly to use the plugin (wine command should be in $PATH of your login shell).</b><br>
Technical topic: The TAK plugin is composed of 2 parts, a backend winelib app and a frontend Cocoa plugin. The backend loads TAK DLL and calls TAK API using the Wine technology, and the frontend interacts with the backend using IPC. This way we can transparently access the TAK DLL as if it were natively supported on OSX.

<li>Improved Gracenote (iTunes) CDDB file importer</li>
Now per-track artist, composer, comment, etc. are recognized.
<li>Updated Sparkle.framework</li>
<li>Added Dutch translation (thanks to Jesse Muller)</li>
<li>Various fixes and improvements</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20080926:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in AAC/ALAC encoding without metadata addition</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20080925:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a log filename issue</li>
<li>XLD now always saves a logfile in the same directory as ripped files</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20080924:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem that produced endian-swapped audio files on PPC machine when using C2 pointers</li>
<li>Updated LAME to version 3.98.2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20080921a:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added option to use C2 error pointers</li>
When the option is turned on, XLD first read a sector in burst mode, and check the occurrence of C2 error. If C2 error occurs, then XLD re-read the sector with cdparanoia. This accelerates ripping extremely for the drive with C2 error support (Plextor, NEC, etc), without losing safety. If you use this option, please make sure that your drive supports reporting C2 errors.
<li>Modified wavpack encoder to store MD5 checksum by default</li>
<li>Added option to prevent XLD from setting offset correction value automatically</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20080921:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some issues with the new cdparanoia engine</li>
<li>Fixed a problem when ripping Mixed Mode CD/Enhanced CD</li>
<li>Removed redundancy of the cue sheet generated by XLD</li>
<li>Offset correction value is now set automatically when opening a CD, if available</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20080919:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Removed all options regarding cache</li>
Now the default setting is the "strongest" one in the previous version (the same as cdparanoia 10.2 default). I'll remove the old engine if there is no problem with this version.
<li>Integrated drive offset database into application</li>
You can select the offset correction value for your drive if it is registered in the database.
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20080916c:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed log style to show the new AR hash with the corrected offset</li>
<b>Please don't be nervous too much about this; it's just an issue of the displaying style. The offset detection algorithm itself isn't changed at all from the beginning.</b>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20080916b:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed AR checking issue of Apple Lossless files</li>
<li>Changed a message in caching ability measurement result, to stop recommending to turn off "Disable Cache" option</li>
Judging from my several experiments, turning off "disable cache" option is not recommended with CDParanoia III 10.2 engine, even if the detected cache size is too small. This tends to generate inconsistent results. Turning "Disable Cache" option on with the minimum strength is recommended for most drives with no cache.
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20080916a:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem that showed invalid "You can turn off Disable Cache option" message on some drives, after measuring caching ability</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20080916:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Supported simultaneous codec conversion</li>
Select "Multiple Formats" in the output format and check the preferred format in the option. Note that WAV, AIFF, PCM and WAVE64 is exclusive each other.
<li>XLD now recognizes '/' (slash) as a directory separator in the filename format field</li>
XLD creates folder automatically. You can save files in the preferred folder by its title, artist, etc.
<li>Supported album artist (%A) and format name (%f) in the filename field</li>
<li>Added option to disable embedding cue sheet in FLAC and WavPack encoder</li>
<li>Integrated drive caching ability measurement routine of CDParanoia III 10.2</li>
To measure, open a CD and choose "Measure Drive Cache Ability" in File menu.
<li>Improved sample length detection routine of Apple Lossless decoder</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href=xld-gui-20080914.tbz>Version 20080914a:</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem that showed meaningless offset correction values when a disc does not present in AccurateRip database</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20080914:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added feature to scan ReplayGain</li>
You can use this feature by choosing "Scan ReplayGain" in File menu
<li>Added option to scan ReplayGain during ripping</li>
The result is displayed in log and written in cue sheet.
<li>Added option to set the strength of the cache defeating ability</li>
Stronger is safer, but slower. Stronger setting will be useful for the drive which has a large cache.
<li>Changed again the deffault caching behavior</li>
Now the default is "Disable cache: ON" and "Strength of cache defeating ability: weakest". 
<li>Added option to switch engine between the new cdparanoia engin and the old one</li>
<li>Changed log messaging style to report the track which matches AccurateRip DB with the different offset as "Accurately ripped" track</li>
<li>REM DATE and REM GENRE line for the cue sheet is now written in the common section</li>
<li>Fixed a problem that disable cache setting is not applied to the test run</li>
<li>Fixed an invalid TLEN tag issue in LAME encoder</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 20080913:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated cdparanoia-III 10.2 engine</li>
Now the meaning of "Disable cache" checkbox has changed :
<ul>
<li>Off: Default. Faster and recommended for the drive with no audio cache.</li>
<li>On: Disable cache using the same way as cdparanoia-III 10.2 does. Very slow, but useful for the drive with audio cache.</li>
